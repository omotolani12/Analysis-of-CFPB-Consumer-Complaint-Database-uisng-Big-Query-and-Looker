# Analysis-of-CFPB-Consumer-Complaint-Database-uisng-Big-Query-and-Looker

The Consumer Complaint Database is a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that we sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, are not published in the Consumer Complaint Database

This project analyses the database using SQL and visualizations.
